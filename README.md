# LOD-Bias

## Description
LOD Bias (Level of Detail Bias) is a graphics setting that adjusts how detailed textures appear at different distances.

## Requirements
- Nvidia GPU
- Direct X or Open GL games<br>
  Contact me if anyone finds a way for Vulkan

## Alternative For AMD GPU'S
- In registry<br>
Contact me if anyone finds a way

## Why
- DEFAULT<br>
  Depends on driver implementation

- POSITIVE<br>
  Textures will look worse, potential performance gain

- CLAY<br>
  Visually less distracting, potential performance gain

## Ban?
This involves merely adjusting a graphics setting. If game developers disapprove, it's their responsibility to address it.<br>
For instance, Rainbow Six Siege allows you to launch the game but displays a warning and restricts online play.<br> 
Conversely, Counter-Strike 2 completely prevents you from launching the game.


## Note
For some game engines, you'll need to manually apply the LOD settings in inspector using the game profile.<br> 
Additionally, you might need to set the read-only option to prevent the settings from being overwritten.
