# LOD-Bias

## Description
LOD Bias (Level of Detail Bias) is a graphics setting that adjusts how detailed textures appear at different distances.

## Requirements
- Nvidia GPU
- Direct X or Open GL games<br>
  Contact me if anyone finds a way for Vulkan

## Alternative For AMD GPU'S
- In registry<br>
Contact me if anyone finds a way

## Why
- DEFAULT<br>
  Depends on driver implementation<br>

- POSITIVE<br>
  Textures will look worse, potential performance gain<br>

- CLAY<br>
  Visually less distracting, potential performance gain<br>

- NEGATIVE<br>
  Textures will look better, potential performance loss<br>

## Ban?
This involves merely adjusting a graphics setting. If game developers disapprove, it's their responsibility to address it.<br>
For instance, Rainbow Six Siege allows you to launch the game but displays a warning and restricts online play.<br> 
Conversely, Counter-Strike 2 completely prevents you from launching the game.

## Note
For some game engines, you'll need to manually apply the LOD settings in inspector using the game profile.<br>

Additionally, you might need to enable the read-only option to prevent the game engine from overwriting the setting.

Some DX12 games may require the shader cache files to be deleted before LOD optimization is applied.

It's unusual that there appears to be no scaling between these settings in multiplayer titles.<br>
I observed a similar pattern with XDefiant and Rainbow Six Siege.<br> 
However, I opted to use Modern Warfare 2 as it's a more consistent benchmark.<br>
